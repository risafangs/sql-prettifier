This repository houses a script for a Streamlit app that is intended to re-format 
difficult-to-read SQL. Currently, supported cleaning functions are:  
- convert uppercase to lowercase
- convert long horizontal lists to vertical lists

Things I want to include but haven't yet are:
- reverting table aliases to the full table name

Cool? cool.
